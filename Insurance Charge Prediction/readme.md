Insurance Charge Prediction
This is my mfirst machine learning model projec. If there is any issue feel free to consult me. In this project we are focusing on the  predicting insurance charges using machine learning techniques. The code you find involves data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, scaling, and training a different models on it.

Dataset
The dataset can be found here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/prediction-of-insurance-charges-using-age-gender).This dataset contains the following columns:
age: age of the insured person
sex: gender of the insured person
bmi: body mass index (a measure of body fat based on height and weight)
children: number of children covered by the insurance
smoker: smoking status of the insured person
region: region where the insured person resides
charges: insurance charges

Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
Install the required dependencies by running pip install pandas numpy joblib sklearn in your working environment.
Run the provided code snippet to perform the necessary data modeling steps.

Additionally, the trained model and necessary preprocessing transformers are saved as joblib files (regressor.joblib, gender.joblib, smoker.joblib, ct.joblib, sc.joblib). These files can be used for future predictions or deployment.

Conclusion
The Insurance Prediction project demonstrates how to preprocess a dataset, train a regression model, and evaluate its performance. You can further enhance the project by exploring different regression algorithms, tuning their parameters, or incorporating feature engineering techniques.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific requirements. Happy coding
